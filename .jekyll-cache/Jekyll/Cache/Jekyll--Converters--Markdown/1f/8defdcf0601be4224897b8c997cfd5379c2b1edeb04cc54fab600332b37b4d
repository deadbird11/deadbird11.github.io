<p>This is my inaugural blog post. On this blog, I plan to talk about how I solved
certain programming problems that I have come across in my projects, discuss the
architectures of some of my solutions, and maybe talk about other, off-computer 
stuff. Mainly, I just love the idea of having my own corner of the internet.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ll probably start with a series about Plume, the programming language I am 
writing a compiler for in Haskell. Itâ€™s been an awesome project because Iâ€™ve 
been able to tackle all sorts of problems that I was honestly scared of when I 
started. This is probably true for other programmers, but I feel like compilers 
(and their inner workings) are something that have often been in the back of my 
mind since I started programming. It <strong>is</strong> the thing you talk to all day with your
keyboard and occasionally yell at.</p>
