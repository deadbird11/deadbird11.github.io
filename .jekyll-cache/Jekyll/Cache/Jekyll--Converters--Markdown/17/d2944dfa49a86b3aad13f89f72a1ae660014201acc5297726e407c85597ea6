<p>This is my inaugural blog post. On this blog, I plan to talk about how I solved certain programming problems that I have come across in my projects, discuss the architectures of some of my solutions, and maybe talk about other, off-computer stuff. Mainly, I just love the idea of having my own corner of the internet. Be ready for many spelling errors.</p>
