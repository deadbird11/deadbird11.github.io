I"µ<h2 id="welcome">Welcome</h2>
<p>This is my inaugural blog post. On this blog, I plan to talk about how I solved
certain programming problems that I have come across in my projects, discuss the
architectures of some of my solutions, and maybe talk about other, off-computer 
stuff. Mainly, I just love the idea of having my own corner of the internet. Also,
I like a lot of programming topics and so I am usually a beginner at something,
so Iâ€™d like to jot down things that I <em>wished</em> I knew when I started learning
a topic. Hopefully that made sense.</p>

<h3 id="plans">Plans</h3>
<p>Iâ€™ll probably start with a series about Plume, the programming language I am 
writing a compiler for in Haskell. Itâ€™s been an awesome project because Iâ€™ve 
been able to tackle all sorts of problems that I was honestly scared of when I 
started. This is probably true for other programmers, but I feel like compilers 
(and their inner workings) are something that have often been in the back of my 
mind since I started programming. It <em>is</em> the thing you talk to all day with your
keyboard and occasionally yell at. I better just save this for the Plume series.</p>

<p>Anyway, Iâ€™ll talk about the stages of the compiler and some of the fun problems 
I had to solve, and how I tried to tackle them with functional programming. Hopefully
people can read it and get a good picture of how to actually break a compiler 
project into do-able parts.</p>

<p>Next, Iâ€™ll do some writing about efgl, my rendering engine. This was also something
that had I had a very fuzzy idea of when I started the project, but now I know
(pretty much) how to design one, or at least figure one out when I find it on 
github.</p>
