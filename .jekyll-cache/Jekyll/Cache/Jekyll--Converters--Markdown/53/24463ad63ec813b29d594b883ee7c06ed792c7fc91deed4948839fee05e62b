I"4<h2 id="welcome">Welcome</h2>
<p>This is my inaugural blog post. On this blog, I plan to talk about how I solved certain programming problems that I have come across in my projects, discuss the architectures of some of my solutions, and maybe talk about other, off-computer stuff. Mainly, I just love the idea of having my own corner of the internet. Also, I like a lot of programming topics and so I am usually a beginner at something, so Iâ€™d like to jot down things that I <em>wished</em> I knew when I started learning a topic. Hopefully that made sense.</p>
