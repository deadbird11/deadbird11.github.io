<p>This is my inaugural blog post. On this blog, I plan to talk about how I solved
certain programming problems that I have come across in my projects, discuss the
architectures of some of my solutions, and maybe talk about other, off-computer 
stuff. Mainly, I just love the idea of having my own corner of the internet.</p>
