## Welcome
This is my inaugural blog post. On this blog, I plan to talk about how I solved
certain programming problems that I have come across in my projects, discuss the
architectures of some of my solutions, and maybe talk about other, off-computer 
stuff. Mainly, I just love the idea of having my own corner of the internet. Also,
I like a lot of programming topics and so I am usually a beginner at something,
so I'd like to jot down things that I *wished* I knew when I started learning
a topic. Hopefully that made sense. 

### Plans
I'll probably start with a series about Plume, the programming language I am 
writing a compiler for in Haskell. It's been an awesome project because I've 
been able to tackle all sorts of problems that I was honestly scared of when I 
started. This is probably true for other programmers, but I feel like compilers 
(and their inner workings) are something that have often been in the back of my 
mind since I started programming. It *is* the thing you talk to all day with your
keyboard and occasionally yell at. I better just save this for the Plume series.

Anyway, I'll talk about the stages of the compiler and some of the fun problems 
I had to solve, and how I tried to tackle them with functional programming. Hopefully
people can read it and get a good picture of how to actually break a compiler 
project into do-able parts. 

Next, I'll do some writing about efgl, my OpenGL rendering engine. This was also something
that had I had a very fuzzy idea of when I started the project, but now I know
(pretty much) how to design one, or at least figure one out when I find it on 
github.

After that, who knows. I'll probably have another project I'm working on by then.
Or maybe I'll write about this website. Or school/my job. 

### Outro
Maybe I'll be the only one that reads this, which is fine with me. 
To sign off, I'll leave a hello world Scala program because I want to break up this 
big chunk of words with a pretty code block.

```scala
object Outro {
    def main(args: Array[String]) = {
        println("Hello world!")
    }
}
```
