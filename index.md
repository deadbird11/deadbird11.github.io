Hi, I'm Eddie. I'm originally from Cincinnati, Ohio (aka "The Paris of the Midwest"),
but I'm usually in Boston for school.

I'm currently a sophomore at Tufts studying CS and I'll probably end up with at 
least a minor in Math. I'm also a developer on [JumboCode](https://www.jumbocode.org/),
where we make hi-tech websites for non-profits.

I love playing ping pong, playing piano, watching tv shows, playing video games,
and learning about space (if you couldn't tell). Programming-wise, I like computer graphics, 
functional programming, and making programming languages. 
I also like messing around with hardware sometimes. I also like web development. 
This list could go on for a while.

Right now, I'm mainly working on writing a compiler for my programming language, 
[plume](https://github.com/e-hat/plume). I'll probably starting 
writing about that on this website soon enough. I'm also learning more about 
computer graphics and working on my [efgl](https://github.com/e-hat/efgl)
project, which is a real-time rendering engine. I really want to get PBR working,
then I want to try a cool shadow algorithm like PCSS. I'll post some images of my renders here. 

I am currently an intern at [Stellar Science](https://www.stellarscience.com/),
where I write C++ and do fun science stuff.

{% include section-title.html words="projects" %}

Here are some of my favorite projects I've worked on over the years:

* **plume** - A C-level programming language that compiles to x86-64 assembly.
  I am currently writing its compiler in Haskell. I'll write about it on this website,
but I'll just mention quickly that it has a fun syntax for low-level programming. 
[github](https://github.com/e-hat/plume)
* **efgl** - A rendering engine written in OpenGL and C++ that 
implements a clustered-forward pipeline with GPU compute. At the moment, 
I'm adding support for PBR. [github](https://github.com/e-hat/efgl)
* **sga** - A genetic algorithm framework that I wrote in modern C++.
It allows the user to define their own genotypes, evaluation functions, crossover 
functions, and mutation functions and handles the actual algorithm on its own. 
[github](https://github.com/e-hat/SGA)
* **cycloid-animation** - One day, I was messing around on desmos with 
[cycloid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycloid) graphs and I made 
an animation out of them that you can find [here](https://editor.p5js.org/deadbird/present/-1TmeUp-Q). 
Note the slider on the left - it changes the level of detail that the animation is 
drawn with, and results in a practically infinite number of different, beautiful animations!
* **onewknd** - My implementation of the 
[ray-tracing in one weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html)
tutorial ([github](https://github.com/e-hat/onewknd)). I'm currently 
working on a [rewrite in Haskell](https://github.com/e-hat/RayTracingOneWeekend-Haskell)
to flex my functional programming skills.
* **mnist-gan** - One of my first forays into ML with Tensorflow and 
python where I implemented a [generative adversarial network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network)
to generate handwritten digits. I used a Deep Convolution GAN (DCGAN) with a Wasserstein loss function.
[github](https://github.com/e-hat/mnistgan)
* **scramble** - A small program I wrote in Go that takes an english
word and finds valid anagrams for it. [github](https://github.com/e-hat/scramble)
* **tldr** - Another small Go program that looks up other command line
tools and prints a description. [github](https://github.com/e-hat/tldr)
