Hi, I'm Yash! I'm from Cincinnati, Ohio and I'm a student at the University of Michigan.

I took a leave of absence last year and worked as a software engineer at [Jupiter (YC S19)](https://jupiter.co). I worked across [our stack](TODO), and among other things built a shoppable recipes marketplace that turned into a core feature and a mobile app that was adopted by >80% of our customers.

&nbsp;

I also took advantage of my time away from school to travel, and spent time living in San Francisco, Maine, and Miami.

If you're considering a gap year, feel free to reach out and I would love to share more of my experience.
